        <p><strong class="text-4xl">Hi!</strong> I'm a backend developer from <a
                    href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Girona/@41.7393927,2.4370537,9.76z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x12bae72798c8fdab:0xaf3845b6a5296a6f!8m2!3d41.9794005!4d2.8214264">Girona,
                Catalonia</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="retro-title-4">C:\Work></h2>
        <p>I'm working at <a href="https://gnahs.com/en">GNA Hotel Solutions</a> to provide our clients the best
            backend code I can. I'm a developer
            for {{ Illuminate\Support\Carbon::now()->diffInYears(Illuminate\Support\Carbon::parse('2013-10-04')) }}
            years now. I started to learn with ASP.NET and Django, but I felt in love with Laravel at the first
            line of code and never looked back.</p>

        <h2 class="retro-title-4">C:\Studying></h2>
        <p>I'm constantly learning new stuff about programming styles and patterns. Mostly focused on the PHP
            world, but I'm doing some steps into the frontend too. I bought a few courses from <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> and <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/wesbos">Wes Bos</a>. I also have a lifetime
            <a href="https://laracasts.com">Laracasts</a> subscription and can't be happier
            with all the content it has. There's always new content to learn.</p>

        <h2 class="retro-title-4">C:\On the side></h2>
        <p>I enjoy building web apps with Laravel and Vue.js. I used to develop API's at my previous job and
            totally loved it, but now I'm more into console commands and backends too.</p>
        <p>I'm starting to experiment with some Vue.js apps, without any back-end code related.</p>

        <h2 class="retro-title-4">C:\Open Source></h2>
        <p>I have contributed with small tweaks to the Laravel framework itself. I also own a few small packages focused to a Laravel application. 
        At the company, I always try to find isolated pieces of code we can release as an Open Source package.</p>

        <h2 class="retro-title-4">C:\Chatbots></h2>
        <p>I discovered the world of chatbots a while ago and I'm building them with <a
                    href="https://botman.io">botman.io</a>. I already have a <a
                    href="https://github.com/Lloople?utf8=âœ“&tab=repositories&q=bot-&type=&language=php">few
                projects on my GitHub</a>. I think it's a topic with a lot of potential for both private and
            commercial use.</p>

        <h2 class="retro-title-4">C:\Watching></h2>
        <p>I'm really disappointed by how Game of Thrones ended. I'm waiting for a new Altered Carbon season, and from
        Disney+ to be released here in Spain.</p>
        <p> I love shows like Black Mirror, Electric Dreams, The Mand in The High Castle...</p>

        <h2 class="retro-title-4">C:\Books></h2>
        <p>I read <strong>Artemis</strong> and <strong>The Martian</strong> by <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/andyweirauthor">Andy Weir</a> which I consider a masterpiece.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed both books wrote by Ernest Cline, Ready Player One and Armada.</p>
        <p>I've also read <strong>Song of Ice and Fire</strong> and all the stories about <strong>Sherlock
                Holmes</strong></p>
        <p>I'm planning to read <strong>The Man In The High Castle</strong>, since I enjoyed the TV show a lot.
            I'm a fan of <strong>The Name of The Wind</strong> by Patrick Rothfuss. I've also read <strong>Harry
                Potter</strong> books a tons of times and enjoyed <strong>Tales from Earthsea</strong> a lot.
        </p>
        <p>I'm starting to read the <strong>Dune</strong> books and a collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov.</p>
        <p>Recently I read Fahrenheit 451 and I totally love it.</p>

        <h2 class="retro-title-4">C:\Fitness></h2>
        <p>I'm subscribed to a gym near work since October 2018. I try to go every single day in the morning
            (unless I'm traveling or something big happened). That's
            about {{ $gymDays }} days!</p>
        <p>I'm starting to feel great with myself and it's helping me with my back pain and mental health. In my
            opinion I think it's very important for all of us to do some exercise. Specially in our profession
            in which we spend almost 12 hours a day sitting down.</p>

        <h2 class="retro-title-4">C:\Waiting List></h2>
        <p>New tools are released quicker than I find projects to try them on. This is my current list of
            things I want to try but can't find the time / project for it ðŸ˜…:</p>
